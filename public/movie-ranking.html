<h1> The Best Movies according to Ghy </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3> Interstellar</h3>
<p> I love this movie because the graphics are awesome. I also love the fact that the mathematics in it is accurate.
    Although it is impossible for us 3D beings to view the world of 4D or higher dimention beings, the way it was protrayed
    was very appealing and overall awesome.

<h3> Salt </h3>
<p> Salt is one of my favorite action movies because first of all, the lead character is female, which was rather rare during
    the time it was released. And the overall story just keeps you on your toes with excitement and anticipation.

<h3> Les Miserables </h3>
<p> I love this movie because I first of all ADORE musicals. You have to watch it in order to appreciate it. </p>
